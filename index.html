        <h1>The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of Fast Fashion</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="test">
<div class="Intro">
    <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
    <p>In recent years, the fast fashion industry has become one of the most profitable industries in the entire world. This industry is especially popular and the most profitable with younger people around ages 14 to 24. The reason for this is the affordability and trendy style of fast fashion clothes, such as graphic t-shirts and 5-inch inseam shorts. It makes sense for college and high school students who do not typically have a lot of money to spend on fashionable clothes. However, what 99% of the consumers of this industry fail to see is the fact that the fast fashion industry is also one of the most harmful to the world.</p>

<div class="Consumption">
    <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
<h2>Water Consumption</h2>
<img src="ff-consumption.png" alt="water consumption">
<p>Water is universally considered to be one of the most vital resources for human life as it is needed for our major bodily systems to function. However, there is more water going into the fast fashion industry than there is going to people. This is because to make these clothes, large quantities of water are required. According to my <a href="hempfoundation.net/water-consumption-of-the-fashion-industry-at-different-stages-how-cutting-it-down-can-impact-the-lives-of-people/#:~:text=Around%2020%2C000%20litres%20of%20water,litres%20of%20water%20to%20make.&amp;text=A%20pair%20of%20cow%20skin%20leather%20boots%20requires%2012%2C370%20litres%20of%20water">fourth source</a>, it takes around 20,000 liters of water to produce just one T-shirt and one pair of jeans. This amount of water is, coincidentally, enough water for a single person to drink for about 900 days. If that much water is used for two simple articles of clothing, try to imagine the amount of water that is used to mass-produce clothes on a global scale. Going back to my fourth article, approximately 5 trillion liters of water are used by the fast fashion industry every year. To put this into perspective, in 2015, enough water was used to fill 32 million Olympic-sized swimming pools. However, even though this unfathomable amount of water is being used by corporations to make money, there are still people in the world who do not have access to clean drinking water. According to <a href="www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/20/cost-cotton-water-challenged-india-world-water-day"> The Guardian</a>, there are over 100 million people in India alone who are not able to drink clean water.</p>

<div class="Labor">
        <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
    <h2>Exploitation in the Industry</h2>
    <img src="fast-fashion-exploitation.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>The industry's rapid production model relies on cheap labor which is almost exclusively taking place in countries where labor costs are low. Not only are the costs of labor low, but the quality of the environment in which the workers work is even lower. However, it does not stop there. My <a href="https://florida.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/60dc0b6d-0b49-4819-b900-cf590b059fd6/rethinking-fast-fashion-after-bangladesh/">first source</a> explains the story of a girl who took a tour for her exchange program in Dhaka, Bangladesh. During her tour, she visited a factory owned by a fast fashion company. When she stepped inside the factory, she was immediately struck by the pungent odor of chemicals. was the predominance of women and children among the factory workers. She later learned that these individuals toiled for extended hours, often day and night while inhaling toxic fumes, making the USD equivalent of less than $2 a day, causing them to make less than the living wage of Dhaka which is around $230. As stated earlier, it is not only adults that are subjected to these inhumane conditions but children as well. My <a href="https://labs.theguardian.com/unicef-child-labour/"> second source</a> states that there are over 170 million children who are forced into doing child labor. This includes a good amount of them working with textiles and garments. Instead of having a regular childhood making friends and being kids, these children are working many more hours every day than they are not working in unsafe environments that lack adequate ventilation and often have faulty machinery that can cause extreme injury.</p>

<div class="Pollution">
    <!-- Paragraph 5 -->
<h2>Pollution</h2>
<img src="ff-polution.jpeg" alt="">
<p>If you thought that the worst of the industry was behind us, you are sadly mistaken. The fast fashion brand is notorious for being one of the most harmful industries in the entire world. It is the cause of some of the most severe damage that our planet has received in its entire history. Fast fashion primarily harms our planet in two ways. The first is through water pollution. As I stated earlier, chemicals such as lead and ink are constantly being used to make these clothes. According to my <a href="www.seasidesustainability.org/post/fast-fashion-series-part-3-what-are-the-sources-of-water-pollution-from-fast-fashion">sixth source</a> , ​​the garbage is thrown into landfills which take hundreds of years to decompose. As a result, these piles sit in the ocean for at least two centuries and are constantly being filled with new clothes which keeps restarting the process. Most people who purchase are unaware that when they press checkout on websites like Shein, they are unintentionally aiding in water pollution. However, it is not their fault as they were never made aware of this and are encouraged by these companies to keep buying with them.

        <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
    <h2>The Clothes</h2>
    <img src="Fast-Fashion-Retail.jpg" alt="Fast Fashion clothes">
    <p>Consumers are drawn to brands like Shein, H&M, and Zara due to their affordability and always in-style clothes. However, these two factors are the exact reason that consumers should be wary when looking to purchase new clothes. The low cost of these clothes stems from their use of low-quality materials, resulting in products that have a short lifespan and quickly wear out, compelling consumers to make frequent purchases. The urge to buy more is then amplified when the first thing that people see is a cool design. What people fail to see is that even though they are purchasing inexpensive clothes right now, they are going to have to buy more clothes not very long after, and they are going to end up spending much more money in the long run with fast fashion as opposed to if they purchased slightly more expensive, higher quality garments. What’s more, the clothes that are produced by these are harmful to the people that wear them. According to my <a href="www.eco-stylist.com/why-is-fast-fashion-bad/#:~:text=Negative%20impacts%20include%20worker%20harassment,dire%20social%20and%20environmental%20impacts"> third source</a>,  there are a multitude of chemicals that are used to make our clothes including lead, phthalates, and PFAs which can all be detrimental to our skin and can potentially cause cancer.</p>
</div>
<div class="Greenwashing">
        <!-- Paragraph 6 -->
    <h2>Greenwashing</h2>
    <img src="greenwashing.webp" alt="greenwashing">
    <p>My final point will be on greenwashing. According to my <a href="https://earth.org/fast-fashion-brands-greenwashing/">final source</a>, greenwashing is when companies present their product or service in a way that makes consumers believe it is environmentally friendly. One brand that is believed to have done this in the past is H&M. Going back to the source, in 2011 they launched a Conscious collection which advertised items that were made with at least “50% sustainable materials”. However, there is still a lack of transparency regarding how they reduce their impact on the environment as well as carbon emissions.</p>
